Tracing Network
==================
## Descriptions
The implementation of the Tracing Network described in the paper 
[Semantically Enhanced Software Traceability Using Deep Learning Techniques](http://jguo-web.com/resources/ICSE2017_JIN_Preprint.pdf) by Jin Guo, Jinghui Cheng, and Jane Cleland-Hang.

## Requirements

- [Torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7)
- [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)
- [nngraph](https://github.com/torch/nngraph)
- [optim](https://github.com/torch/optim)
- Python >= 2.7

## Acknowledgement
The implementation of Tracing Network is based on the Semantic Relatedness architecture described in the paper [Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory
Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075) and the implemented [here](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/treelstm).
